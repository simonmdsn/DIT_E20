    <p>This is the usual structure of dynamic web pages: css, images and JavaScript scripts are kept in separate files, in specific folders.
	<br/>The JavaScript code and the styles are "painted on" without the HTML showing too many details; 
	hence, separation among data (HMTL), presentation style (CSS) and behavior (JavaScript).</p>
